- Add in 3D rotation etc          ???
- Check calculation for viscosity ???

- Packing/Jamming
- Pryamitsyn OR Pan papers (both adaptations of Fluid Particle Model but with different potentials)
    - Pryamitsyn has soft Solvent-Solvent forces and LJ potentials for Solvent-Colloid and Colloid-Colloid
    - Pan has soft S-S, very soft C-S and hard C-C. (page ~83 pdf pagenum)
