Todo:
------
- Check calculation for viscosity
    - Green-Kubo (indiv. particles version)


Future Investigations:
----------------------
    - Packing/Jamming state -- phi very near phi_max -- Flowability of water at such scales
    - Nonhomogeneous particle sizes -- Similar to how the supercooled water has varying sizes of "solid" water

Reference:
----------
- Pryamitsyn OR Pan papers (both adaptations of Fluid Particle Model but with different potentials)
    - Pryamitsyn has soft Solvent-Solvent forces and LJ potentials for Solvent-Colloid and Colloid-Colloid
    - Pan has soft S-S, very soft C-S and hard C-C. (page ~83 pdf pagenum)
