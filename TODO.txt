Todo:
-----
- Several definitions of stress tensor
- Does viscosity diverge? -- Explore viscosity with even more particles
- Effects of changing hardness of particles
- Try to keep pressure constant -- effects of number of water present
- Compare LE-SLLOD viscosity vs Green-Kubo viscosity


Future Investigations:
----------------------
    - Packing/Jamming state -- phi very near phi_max -- Flowability of water at such scales
    - Nonhomogeneous particle sizes -- Similar to how the supercooled water has varying sizes of "solid" water

- Pryamitsyn OR Pan papers (both adaptations of Fluid Particle Model but with different potentials)
    - Pryamitsyn has soft Solvent-Solvent forces and LJ potentials for Solvent-Colloid and Colloid-Colloid
    - Pan has soft S-S, very soft C-S and hard C-C. (page ~83 pdf pagenum)
