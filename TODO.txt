- Effects of changing hardness of particles
    * Rerun with SLLOD
- Effects of particle sizes
    * Running....
- Nonhomogeneous particle sizes -- Similar to how the supercooled water has varying sizes of "solid" water
    * Viscosity measurements as a function of size/stdev
    * Take pictures of state
- Packing/Jamming state -- phi very near phi_max -- Flowability of water at such scales
    * Take pictures of jammed state - vary shear rates and particle size
    * Measure coordination number -- randomness

Reference:
----------
- Pryamitsyn OR Pan papers (both adaptations of Fluid Particle Model but with different potentials)
    - Pryamitsyn has soft Solvent-Solvent forces and LJ potentials for Solvent-Colloid and Colloid-Colloid
    - Pan has soft S-S, very soft C-S and hard C-C. (page ~83 pdf pagenum)
